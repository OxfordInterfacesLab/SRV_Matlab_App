# Interface Recombination Calculator

This interface recombination calculator is programmed as a Matlab App using the extended Shockley-Read-Hall interface recombination model,  with Girisch and Aberle’s iterative algorithm.

Shockley-Read-Hall formalism for defect-mediated recombination is detailed in [1–3], and it is extended to an arbitrary trap level density function in [4]. 

To calculate surface recombination velocity (SRV) we use the algorithm below as described in [4,5].

The silicon space charge density is calculated after the work in [6,7].

This app was developed in support of the publication "Charge at the Si-SiO2 Interface and its Effect on Surface Recombination in Solar Cells", Ruy S Bonilla, Isabel Al-Dhahir, Mingzhe Yu, Phillip Hamer, Pietro Altermatt. Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells, 2020.
